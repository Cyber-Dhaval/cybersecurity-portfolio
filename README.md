## 🔎 About Me
I’m a cybersecurity researcher specializing in **threat modeling** and practical lab work. I enjoy breaking systems to understand them, then designing controls that actually mitigate risk.

- 🧠 Interests: Threat Modeling, Application Security, Cloud Hardening, SOC Analysis
- 🧰 Current Stack: Python, Bash, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Splunk, ELK, Nmap, Metasploit, OWASP ZAP
- 🚀 Goals: Build robust, actionable security designs and share knowledge via write-ups.

## 🧩 Skills & Tools
**Technical:**  
- Offensive: Recon, Exploitation, Web App Testing, CTFs  
- Defensive: SIEM (Splunk/ELK), Threat Hunting, Incident Response, Log Analysis  
- Design: Threat Modeling (STRIDE, LINDDUN), DFDs, Attack Trees

**Cloud & DevSecOps:**  
- AWS/Azure hardening, IAM, Security Groups, CI/CD security checks

**Methodologies & Frameworks:**  
- OWASP ASVS, SAMM, Top 10 • NIST CSF • ISO 27001 • MITRE ATT&CK
